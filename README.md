![ScudCloud Logo](/scudcloud-1.0/resources/scudcloud.png?raw=true "Scud clouds are low, ragged and wind-torn cloud fragments, usually not attached to the thunderstorm base. With the 'mother' cloud, the form of them together is like a chat balloon")

ScudCloud is a **non official** open-source Linux (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Mint) desktop client for [Slack&copy;](http://slack.com).

[Slack&copy;](http://slack.com) is a platform for team communication.

* multiple teams support,
* native system notifications,
* count of unread direct mentions at launcher/sytray icon,
* alert/wobbling on new messages,
* channels quicklist (Unity only),
* optional "Close to Tray".
